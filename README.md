# blogtionary
I like to read books and onlines blogs. But I love when skilled professionals take their time to write something from their thoughts and experiences. These writings are great resources for professional career and life. In no particular order, I am creating this so that I can keep track of them in one place.This list may be very biased towards achieving my goal about life, work, failure and success.
